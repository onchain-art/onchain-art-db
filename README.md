# On-Chain Art Database

## What is on-chain art?
On-Chain Art is a pioneering initiative to document on-chain projects.

Most NFTs store their data off-chain (meaning off the "blockchain") due to the high cost of storing data on the blockchain itself. These NFTs store an identifier that points back to the description of the artwork and the corresponding visuals. However, if the server or the database to which the identifier points goes down, the art also disappears. This vulnerability contradicts the ethos of immutability that a distributed ledger should uphold.

To address this issue, a new paradigm has emerged among smart contract developers and artists: on-chain art. The term "on-chain" refers to the practice of storing code, artwork, and/or metadata directly on the blockchain, ensuring permanence and immutability. As long as the Ethereum network exists, the data will be permanently stored on it. This reliance on the Ethereum Virtual Machine presents numerous constraints, which in turn stimulate creativity.

A list of on-chain projects live on the mainnet has been documented by tens of people on the [0xchain.art](0xchain.art) website.

   This specific entry represents the "Tiny Explorers" project, which is a collection of fully on-chain explorers. 


## Data Access
The data for the on-chain art projects is stored in two files:

- [data.csv](https://github.com/onchain-art/onchain-art-db/blob/main/data/data.csv): CSV format
- [data.md](https://github.com/onchain-art/onchain-art-db/blob/main/data/data.md): md format

Please note that both files contain the same data, just in different formats. Choose the one that best fits your needs.
